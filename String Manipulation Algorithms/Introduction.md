<strong>String Manipulation Algorithms</strong>

Some of the classic tests used in job interviews is how to manipulate strings. Not only does this act as a proxy for your programming knowledge and problem solving but it can be used to see if you are properly prepared for the job interview.

Some of the questions asked include some of the following or variations of the following:

<p>Given two strings of characters determine if they are anagrams of each other</p>
<p>Reverse a string using recursion</p>
<p>Find duplicate characters in the string</p>
<p>Count the number of vowels in a given string</p>
<p>Count the number of constanants in a given string</p>
<p>Count the number of occurances of a particular character in a string</p>
<p>Find a string within a string</p>
<p>Given a string determine if it is a palindrome</p>
<p>Given a string find the first non-repeating character</p>
<p>Find and print duplicate characters in a string if any are found</p>
