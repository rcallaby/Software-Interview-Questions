<strong>String Manipulation Algorithms</strong>

Some of the classic tests used in job interviews is how to manipulate strings. Not only does this act as a proxy for your programming knowledge and problem solving but it can be used to see if you are properly prepared for the job interview.

Some of the questions asked include some of the following or variations of the following:

Given two strings of characters determine if they are anagrams of each other
Reverse a string using recursion
Find duplicate characters in the string
Count the number of vowels in a given string
Count the number of constanants in a given string
Count the number of occurances of a particular character in a string
Find a string within a string
Given a string determine if it is a palindrome
Given a string find the first non-repeating character
