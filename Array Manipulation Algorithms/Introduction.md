<strong>Array Manipulation Algorithms<strong>

There are many variations of these algorithms out in the wild. You should anticipate that some of these questions will be modified so that they are unique. Practicing on unique questions will get you farther in your career.

<p>Given an array of 50 numbers. or any such variation of this, find the first missing number in the sequence</p>
<p>Given an array of 200 numbers find the first duplicate number in this array</p>
<p>Given an array of 150 numbers find all duplicate numbers in this array</p>
<p>Given an array of 50 numbers, that have not been ordered, find the largest and smallest number</p>
<p>Given an array of 200 numbers find all the duplicates in this array</p>
<p>Sort an array of 50 numbers in place using the quicksort algorithm</p>
<p>Sort an array of 140 numbers in place using the bubble sort algorithm</p>
<p>Reverse an array in place</p>
<p>Remove all duplicates of an array using the most efficent method</p>
