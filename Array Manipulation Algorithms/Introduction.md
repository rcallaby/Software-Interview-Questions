<strong>Array Manipulation Algorithms<strong>

There are many variations of these algorithms out in the wild. You should anticipate that some of these questions will be modified so that they are unique. Practicing on unique questions will get you farther in your career.

Given an array of 50 numbers. or any such variation of this, find the first missing number in the sequence
Given an array of 200 numbers find the duplicate number in this array
Given an array of 150 numbers find all duplicate numbers in this array
Given an array of 50 numbers, that have not been ordered, find the largest and smallest number
Given an array of 200 numbers find all the duplicates in this array
Sort an array of 50 numbers in place using the quicksort algorithm
Sort an array of 140 numbers in place using the bubble sort algorithm
Reverse an array in place
Remove all duplicates of an array using the most efficent method
