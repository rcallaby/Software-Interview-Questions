# Contributing to the Software Interview Questions Repository


## Here are the guidelines we follow:

Submitting a Question or Solution

 * Create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) of the repository. This will create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.
 * Make your changes in your fork. Be sure to follow the [formatting guidelines](#formatting-guidelines) outlined below. 
 * [Commit](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit) your changes and [push](https://github.com/git-guides/git-push) them to your fork.
 * Submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to the main repository. This will notify the maintainers of the repository and allow them to review and potentially merge your changes.
