# Software Interview Questions

This is a respository of potential software interview questions and their answers in multiple programming languages. This was created to be a resource for anyone learning computer science, preparing for a job interview, or just for educational purposes for those that are curious. Over time, I hope this will be an excellent resource for those that need to learn this information. If you have something to add to this repository please feel free to contribute.

You should be able to see multiple languages in this repository as it becomes fleshed out in further detail. Such programming languages that this repository will include the following:

* C
* C++
* C#
* Python
* JavaScript



The manner of which these code examples are organized is a work in progress, however, here is a small outline of what is contained in this repository.

* Array Manipulation Algorithms
* Binary Search Algorithms
* Hash Tables
* Data Structures
* Linked List
* Image Processing
* Mathematics Algorithms
* Miscelleanous
* Sets
* String Manipulation Algorithms

As well, these data structures and algorithms do not come from any one external source. While some may be inspired by what I find on the Internet many of these data structures and algorithms will be either widely known accepted data structures and algorithms or sufficently unique as they are modified from other sources.
