<strong>Software-Interview-Questions</strong>

This is a respository of potential software interview questions and their answers in multiple programming languages.

You should be able to see multiple languages in this repository as it becomes fleshed out in further detail. Such programming languages that this repository will include the following
    C
    C++
    C#
    Python
    JavaScript
    
Further, more programming languages will be added as I become more familiar with them and have the resources to handle them.

As well, these algorithms or questions do not come from any one external source. While some may be inspired by what I find on the Internet many of these questions will be either widely known accepted questions or sufficently unique as they are modified from other sources.

Any attempt to take this repository down through a DMCA request will be considered illegal and legal action will be taken against those who attempt to perform such actions.
