<strong>Linked List Algorithms</strong>

The linked list is a common data structure. As such, it is commonly tested in coding interviews and it is a good thing to know just for common knowledge.

Here you should eventually find solutions to some of the follow questions.

<ul>
    <li>Find the middle element of a singly linked list in one pass</li>
    <li>Determine if a linked list contains a cycle</li>
    <li>Reverse a linked list</li>
    <li>Reverse a singly linked list without using recursion</li>
    <li>Determine the length of a singly linked list</li>
</ul>
